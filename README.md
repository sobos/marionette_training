Sample application from "Backbone.Marionette.js: A Gentle Introduction" book by David Sulc.
The application is completely reworked, solely based on Require.js module structure and
completed with r.js optimisation.

Bootstarp.js is used instead of JqueryUI dialog box. CSS formatting requires further improvement
including responsiveness.
